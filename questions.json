    "Question": "A 62-year-old woman presents with progressive right-sided weakness, spasticity, and hyperreflexia. MRI reveals a left parasagittal meningioma compressing the motor cortex. Which cortical region is most likely affected to produce these deficits?",
    "OptionA": "Left lateral precentral gyrus representing the face and hand",
    "OptionB": "Left medial precentral gyrus representing the leg area within the paracentral lobule",
    "OptionC": "Right medial precentral gyrus representing the leg",
    "OptionD": "Left frontal eye field in the middle frontal gyrus",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Explanation": "The leg area of the primary motor cortex is represented medially in the precentral gyrus within the paracentral lobule; a left parasagittal mass compressing this region produces contralateral right leg weakness and spasticity. Distractor A is incorrect because the lateral precentral gyrus represents the face and hand, not the leg."

    "Question": "A technologist is recording median nerve SEPs with a sampling rate of 2500 Hz and a low-pass filter at 1000 Hz. The recording is contaminated with high-frequency noise. Which adjustment best prevents aliasing of frequencies above the Nyquist limit while preserving physiologic bandwidth?",
    "OptionA": "Decrease sampling rate to 1000 Hz",
    "OptionB": "Apply analog anti-aliasing low-pass filter before digitization and increase sampling rate if needed",
    "OptionC": "Increase high-pass filter to 500 Hz",
    "OptionD": "Use digital notch filter post-acquisition",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",

Early in the case, peripheral and spinal responses are stable, but cortical P37 amplitude gradually decreases by 55% with a 1 ms latency increase. Spinal responses remain unchanged. MAP is stable at 75 mmHg. Which is the most appropriate interpretation?",
    "OptionA": "Focal dorsal column lesion at the thoracic level",
    "OptionB": "Possible cortical or subcortical ischemia or anesthetic effect, as peripheral and spinal components are preserved but cortical responses are reduced",

    "OptionD": "Technical failure of stimulation",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Explanation": "When peripheral and spinal SEP components are stable but cortical amplitudes decrease significantly, the change localizes rostral to the spinal recording site and may reflect cortical/subcortical ischemia or anesthetic effects rather than dorsal column injury at the surgical level.

    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Isolated loss of MEPs in myotomes innervated by C5–C6 with preserved contralateral and leg MEPs and stable SEPs suggests focal mechanical compromise at that segment from hardware; prompt inspection and repositioning can prevent permanent injury. Distractor A is incorrect because anesthetic variability is unlikely with stable anesthesia."

    "Question": "A 65-year-old man undergoing thoracolumbar fusion is monitored with MEPs and SEPs. He is on a propofol TIVA (100 µg/kg/min) and remifentanil. To control hypertension, the anesthesiologist begins a dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.5 µg/kg/hr. Over the next 20 minutes, MEPs remain robust and SEPs stable. EEG shows spindle-like frontal activity. Which mechanism best explains this preserved neuromonitoring profile compared with adding more propofol or volatile anesthetic?",
    "OptionA": "Dexmedetomidine is a GABA agonist that blocks all cortical output",
    "OptionB": "Dexmedetomidine acts as an alpha-2 agonist in the locus coeruleus, producing a sleep-like state with modest cortical depression and relatively minor impact on MEP and SEP amplitudes at moderate doses",
    "OptionC": "Dexmedetomidine is a neuromuscular blocker that improves MEP amplitudes",
    "OptionD": "Dexmedetomidine abolishes SEPs while preserving MEPs",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Dexmedetomidine provides sedation via alpha-2 receptor activation in the locus coeruleus, inducing a sleep-like EEG pattern with relatively limited suppression of cortical and spinal excitability compared with higher-dose GABAergic agents, thereby preserving MEPs and SEPs. Distractor A is incorrect because dexmedetomidine is not a GABA agonist."

    "OptionC": "Demyelination of corticospinal tracts mimicking the sign",
    "OptionD": "Ischemic gliosis confined to the basis pontis",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Explanation": "The hot cross bun sign in multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type (MSA-C) reflects selective degeneration of pontine neurons and transverse pontocerebellar fibers, disrupting inhibitory cerebellar modulation via dentato-rubro-olivary pathways and contributing to cerebellar outflow disinhibition. Distractor A is incorrect because cortical Lewy bodies are associated with Parkinson's disease, not MSA-C."

    "OptionA": "Raise the high-pass filter to 500 Hz",
    "OptionB": "Ask anesthesia to deepen neuromuscular blockade or reduce jaw muscle tone, and ensure the patient’s jaw and head are supported to minimize EMG",
    "OptionC": "Lower the low-pass filter to 30 Hz",
    "OptionD": "Increase stimulus intensity to 120 dB nHL",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",

Postoperatively, the patient has transient paraparesis but improves significantly over several months. Which statement best explains the prognostic role of the D-wave in this scenario?",
    "OptionA": "D-wave preservation above approximately 50–70% of baseline predicts relatively favorable long-term motor recovery despite transient MEP loss",
    "OptionB": "Any D-wave reduction indicates irreversible motor deficit",
    "OptionC": "D-wave monitoring is irrelevant if MEPs are abnormal",
    "OptionD": "D-wave changes reflect only dorsal column integrity",
    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Explanation": "D-waves reflect direct corticospinal integrity; sustained amplitudes above about 50–70% of baseline correlate with good long-term motor outcomes, even if muscle MEPs transiently disappear due to reversible synaptic or spinal motor neuron dysfunction.

    "OptionC": "Stop propofol and run sevoflurane at 1.0 MAC",
    "OptionD": "Add benzodiazepines for deeper anesthesia",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",

MRI reveals a left occipital infarct extending to involve the splenium of the corpus callosum. Which disconnection best explains his alexia without agraphia?",
    "OptionA": "Disconnection of right visual cortex from left frontal motor cortex",
    "OptionB": "Disconnection of right visual cortex from left language (angular gyrus) areas via splenial callosal fibers",
    "OptionC": "Disconnection of left motor cortex from Broca area",
    "OptionD": "Disconnection of cerebellum from red nucleus",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Alexia without agraphia occurs when visual information from the right occipital cortex cannot reach left language regions due to splenial callosal damage; the patient can write but cannot read, including self-produced text.

    "OptionA": "True slowing of neural conduction",
    "OptionB": "Filter phase shift due to the narrower low-pass bandwidth, which can slightly delay and smooth fast transients",
    "OptionC": "Increased stimulus artifact",
    "OptionD": "Improved electrode contact",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",

MAP has fallen from 80 to 60 mmHg. Which action is most appropriate?",
    "OptionA": "Observe only, as SEPs remain recordable",
    "OptionB": "Immediately notify the team, restore MAP toward baseline, and evaluate surgical factors that may compromise cord perfusion",
    "OptionC": "Stop MEP monitoring because SEPs are more reliable",
    "OptionD": "Increase anesthetic depth further",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",

    "OptionA": "4 mA is clearly safe, and no action is needed",
    "OptionB": "A low threshold of 4 mA suggests the screw path may be breaching or closely approaching the medial wall and nerve root; the surgeon should inspect and consider redirection",
    "OptionC": "Higher thresholds indicate more dangerous breaches",
    "OptionD": "Triggered EMG thresholds have no relation to pedicle integrity",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Triggered EMG thresholds below about 5–6 mA indicate close proximity to the nerve root or a medial breach; such findings warrant careful inspection and possible revision of the screw trajectory.

The anesthesia team lowers MAP from 100 to 55 mmHg with nitroprusside. Shortly afterward, MEPs from both legs drop by 70%, while SEPs are relatively preserved. Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
    "OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",
    "OptionB": "Autoregulation is shifted to higher pressures, so the lower limit of spinal cord autoregulation is elevated and MAP 55 mmHg may fall below that threshold, compromising perfusion of anterior spinal tracts",
    "OptionC": "Spinal cord perfusion is independent of MAP",
    "OptionD": "SEPs are always more sensitive than MEPs to ischemia",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Chronic hypertension shifts autoregulatory curves rightward, raising the lower limit of perfusion; aggressive hypotension can drop MAP below this range, particularly affecting anterior spinal cord motor pathways, which is reflected first in MEP changes. Distractor A is incorrect because autoregulation is shifted to higher, not lower, pressures in chronic hypertension."

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
    "OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
    "OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
    "OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",

Which mechanism best explains this preserved neuromonitoring profile compared with adding more propofol or volatile anesthetic?",
    "OptionA": "Dexmedetomidine is a GABA agonist that blocks all cortical output",

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
    "OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
    "OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
    "OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",

Lower extremity muscle MEPs are absent. What is the most appropriate interpretation and surgical implication of this finding?",
"OptionA": "A D-wave amplitude above 20% of baseline predicts full motor recovery, so resection can safely continue without modification",
"OptionB": "A reduction in D-wave amplitude greater than 50% of baseline suggests a high risk of persistent motor deficit and warrants stopping or substantially limiting further resection",

Which mechanism best accounts for this EEG pattern and the relative preservation of MEPs?",
"OptionA": "GABAergic enhancement in the cortex produces diffuse high-amplitude delta slowing with complete suppression of MEPs",

What property of the amplifier has been improved, and why does this enhance BAEP waveform fidelity?",
"OptionA": "Input impedance has increased, selectively shortening peak latencies without altering shape",

Sodium nitroprusside is titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure from 95 mmHg to 50 mmHg to control bleeding. MEPs rapidly decline by 70% in amplitude, whereas SEPs are unchanged. Which consideration should guide the anesthesiologist’s immediate hemodynamic management?",
"OptionA": "Maintain low blood pressure because SEPs are normal and MEPs are insensitive to ischemia",

Midway through the resection, upper extremity muscle MEPs disappear while lower extremity MEPs are preserved; D-wave amplitude remains at 85% of baseline. What prognosis does this pattern suggest for upper extremity motor function?",
"OptionA": "Poor prognosis with permanent severe weakness",
"OptionB": "Reasonable prognosis for substantial recovery because corticospinal tract integrity is largely preserved as reflected by the D-wave, despite transient synaptic or conduction block to muscles",
"OptionC": "No prognostic information can be inferred",
"OptionD": "Guaranteed complete recovery within hours",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Preserved D-wave amplitude indicates ongoing corticospinal conduction; muscle MEP loss in the setting of preserved D-wave suggests transient dysfunction at the spinal or neuromuscular level and generally predicts better recovery than if D-wave amplitude were severely reduced.[web:24][web:27][web:33]"

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
"OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",

"OptionA": "Chronic hypertension shifts autoregulation to lower pressures",
"OptionB": "Chronic hypertension shifts autoregulation to higher pressures, so MAP 55 mmHg may fall below the lower limit of spinal cord autoregulation and risk anterior cord ischemia",
"OptionC": "Spinal cord perfusion is independent of MAP",
"OptionD": "SEPs are more sensitive than MEPs to ischemia",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "In chronic hypertension, the autoregulatory curve is shifted rightwards; aggressive hypotension can lower MAP below the perfusion threshold for the anterior spinal cord, causing MEP changes before SEPs.[web:27][web:33][web:117]"

Which concept best explains why the spinal cord may be especially vulnerable at this MAP in a chronically hypertensive patient?",
"OptionA": "Autoregulation is shifted to lower pressures in chronic hypertension",

"OptionA": "Increase nitrous oxide to 70%",
"OptionB": "Discontinue nitrous oxide and reduce sevoflurane toward 0–0.3 MAC while increasing TIVA support",
"OptionC": "Stop propofol and run sevoflurane at 1.0 MAC",
"OptionD": "Add benzodiazepines for deeper anesthesia",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Nitrous oxide and volatile agents significantly depress MEPs; discontinuing nitrous oxide and minimizing volatile anesthetic while relying on TIVA improves corticospinal excitability and MEP amplitude.

"Question": "A 55-year-old man presents with right-sided hemiballismus involving violent, flinging movements of the right arm and leg. MRI shows a small infarct in the left subthalamic nucleus. Which basal ganglia mechanism best explains this movement disorder?",
"OptionA": "Increased subthalamic excitation of the internal globus pallidus leading to reduced thalamocortical activity",
"OptionB": "Reduced subthalamic drive to the internal globus pallidus, leading to decreased thalamic inhibition and excessive cortical motor output",
"OptionC": "Loss of dopamine from substantia nigra pars compacta",
"OptionD": "Lesion of the cerebellar dentate nucleus",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Subthalamic nucleus lesions reduce excitation of the internal globus pallidus, decreasing inhibitory output to the thalamus and producing excessive, poorly controlled movement manifested as hemiballismus. Distractor A is incorrect because increased subthalamic excitation would reduce movement."

"Question": "A patient with suspected thoracic myelopathy undergoes posterior tibial SEP testing. Popliteal responses are normal; lumbar potentials are present but low in amplitude and delayed, and cortical P37 is further delayed with reduced amplitude. Which anatomic level is primarily implicated?",
"OptionA": "Peripheral tibial nerve distal to the ankle",
"OptionB": "Dorsal columns in the thoracic spinal cord",
"OptionC": "Primary somatosensory cortex only",
"OptionD": "Cervical dorsal columns",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Normal peripheral responses with delayed and low-amplitude spinal and cortical components localize pathology to dorsal columns in the spinal cord between the stimulation site and the lumbar recording, consistent with thoracic myelopathy. Distractor A is incorrect because peripheral nerve lesions affect popliteal responses."

"Question": "During anterior cervical corpectomy, MEPs from the right hand muscles decline abruptly to 30% of baseline, while left hand and bilateral leg MEPs and median SEPs remain stable. MAP and anesthesia are unchanged. The surgeon has just inserted a cage and plate at C5–C6. What is the best next step?",
"OptionA": "Attribute the change to anesthetic variability and continue",
"OptionB": "Alert the surgeon to probable right-sided cervical cord or root compromise and request immediate inspection and possible adjustment of the cage/plate",
"OptionC": "Stop MEP monitoring and rely on SEPs only",
"OptionD": "Administer neuromuscular blocker to improve MEPs",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Focal loss of right upper extremity MEPs with preserved contralateral and lower extremity responses suggests local compromise of right-sided cervical cord or roots at the surgical level, necessitating immediate hardware inspection. Distractor A is incorrect because anesthetic variability is unlikely with stable anesthesia."

"Question": "A 65-year-old woman undergoing scoliosis surgery is on TIVA with stable MEPs and SEPs. The anesthesiologist considers substituting a long-acting nonselective beta-blocker for an esmolol infusion used for heart rate control. Which risk is most relevant to neuromonitoring?",
"OptionA": "Long-acting beta-blockers are easier to titrate if hypotension compromises cord perfusion",
"OptionB": "Long-acting beta-blockers may cause hypotension that is slower to reverse, making it harder to promptly correct perfusion-related neuromonitoring changes",
"OptionC": "Esmolol always abolishes MEPs",
"OptionD": "Beta-blockers have no hemodynamic effect",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Longer-acting nonselective beta-blockers are less easily titrated and reversed than esmolol; hypotension triggered by such agents is harder to correct quickly if neuromonitoring signals indicate compromised cord perfusion. Distractor A is incorrect because long-acting agents are harder, not easier, to titrate."

"Question": "A 29-year-old man with focal seizures has an EEG that shows frequent sharp waves at T3 and T5 with a left temporal field. During sleep, the spikes increase in frequency. MRI shows left hippocampal sclerosis. Which statement best reflects the significance of these findings?",
"OptionA": "They are benign sleep transients with no epileptogenic significance",
"OptionB": "They are interictal epileptiform discharges localizing to the left temporal lobe, concordant with mesial temporal sclerosis",
"OptionC": "They prove generalized epilepsy",
"OptionD": "They indicate primary occipital lobe epilepsy",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Temporal sharp waves maximal at T3/T5 with a left temporal field represent interictal epileptiform discharges localizing to the left temporal lobe, and their concordance with left hippocampal sclerosis supports a diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy. Distractor A is incorrect because these are not benign sleep transients."

"Question": "A 70-year-old woman with delirium from pneumonia undergoes EEG. The recording shows generalized slowing with irregular theta and delta activity, but no clear periodicity or epileptiform discharges. As her infection and metabolic status improve, her EEG normalizes. Which conclusion is most appropriate?",
"OptionA": "The EEG pattern is consistent with diffuse toxic–metabolic encephalopathy rather than primary epilepsy",
"OptionB": "The EEG proves nonconvulsive status epilepticus",
"OptionC": "The EEG is pathognomonic for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease",
"OptionD": "The EEG indicates a focal structural lesion",
"CorrectAnswer": "A",
"Explanation": "Diffuse generalized slowing without epileptiform discharges is typical of toxic–metabolic encephalopathy and is reversible with treatment of the underlying cause. Distractor B is incorrect because nonconvulsive status epilepticus would show periodic or rhythmic epileptiform activity."

"Question": "During anterior thoracic spinal surgery, posterior tibial SEPs are monitored. Early in the case, peripheral and spinal responses are stable, but cortical P37 amplitude gradually decreases by 55% with a 1 ms latency increase. Spinal responses remain unchanged. MAP is stable at 75 mmHg. Which is the most appropriate interpretation?",
"OptionA": "Focal dorsal column lesion at the thoracic level",
"OptionB": "Possible cortical or subcortical ischemia or anesthetic effect, as peripheral and spinal components are preserved but cortical responses are reduced",
"OptionC": "Peripheral tibial neuropathy",
"OptionD": "Technical failure of stimulation",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "When peripheral and spinal SEP components are stable but cortical amplitudes decrease significantly, the change localizes rostral to the spinal recording site and may reflect cortical/subcortical ischemia or anesthetic effects rather than dorsal column injury at the surgical level. Distractor A is incorrect because dorsal column lesions affect spinal, not cortical, responses."

"Question": "A 39-year-old woman with suspected cervical myelitis undergoes median nerve SEP testing. N9 at the brachial plexus is normal, but N13 at the cervical cord is delayed and low in amplitude; cortical N20 is also delayed. Posterior tibial SEPs are normal. Which lesion localization is most likely?",
"OptionA": "Thoracic cord dorsal column lesion",
"OptionB": "Cervical cord dorsal column lesion affecting upper extremity pathways",
"OptionC": "Peripheral neuropathy in the lower extremities",
"OptionD": "Diffuse cortical lesion",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Abnormal N13 and N20 with normal Erb’s point responses suggest a lesion between the brachial plexus and cortex, localizing to cervical dorsal column pathways; normal posterior tibial SEPs argue against a thoracic cord lesion. Distractor A is incorrect because thoracic cord lesions affect lower extremity SEPs."

"Question": "During a C5–C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, transcranial MEPs from right biceps and extensor carpi radialis abruptly disappear immediately after placement of an interbody cage, while left arm and bilateral leg MEPs remain stable. SEPs are unchanged. MAP and anesthesia are stable. Which action is most appropriate?",
"OptionA": "Attribute the change to anesthetic variability and continue without modification",
"OptionB": "Alert the surgeon that right C5–C6 root or segmental cord compromise is likely and request immediate inspection and possible repositioning of the cage or plate",
"OptionC": "Stop MEP monitoring and rely on SEPs only",
"OptionD": "Administer neuromuscular blocker to improve MEP quality",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Isolated loss of MEPs in myotomes innervated by C5–C6 with preserved contralateral and leg MEPs and stable SEPs suggests focal mechanical compromise at that segment from hardware; prompt inspection and repositioning can prevent permanent injury. Distractor A is incorrect because anesthetic variability is unlikely with stable anesthesia."

"Question": "During resection of a thoracic intramedullary astrocytoma, D-wave amplitude recorded from an epidural electrode at T6 decreases to 65% of baseline and remains stable, while leg muscle MEPs are intermittently absent. Postoperatively, the patient has transient paraparesis but improves significantly over several months. Which statement best explains the prognostic role of the D-wave in this scenario?",
"OptionA": "D-wave preservation above approximately 50–70% of baseline predicts relatively favorable long-term motor recovery despite transient MEP loss",
"OptionB": "Any D-wave reduction indicates irreversible motor deficit",
"OptionC": "D-wave monitoring is irrelevant if MEPs are abnormal",
"OptionD": "D-wave changes reflect only dorsal column integrity",
"CorrectAnswer": "A",
"Explanation": "D-waves reflect direct corticospinal integrity; sustained amplitudes above about 50–70% of baseline correlate with good long-term motor outcomes, even if muscle MEPs transiently disappear due to reversible synaptic or spinal motor neuron dysfunction. Distractor B is incorrect because D-wave reduction does not always indicate irreversible deficit."

"Question": "A 65-year-old man undergoing thoracolumbar fusion is monitored with MEPs and SEPs. He is on a propofol TIVA (100 µg/kg/min) and remifentanil. To control hypertension, the anesthesiologist begins a dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.5 µg/kg/hr. Over the next 20 minutes, MEPs remain robust and SEPs stable. EEG shows spindle-like frontal activity. Which mechanism best explains this preserved neuromonitoring profile compared with adding more propofol or volatile anesthetic?",
"OptionA": "Dexmedetomidine is a GABA agonist that blocks all cortical output",
"OptionB": "Dexmedetomidine acts as an alpha-2 agonist in the locus coeruleus, producing a sleep-like state with modest cortical depression and relatively minor impact on MEP and SEP amplitudes at moderate doses",
"OptionC": "Dexmedetomidine is a neuromuscular blocker that improves MEP amplitudes",
"OptionD": "Dexmedetomidine abolishes SEPs while preserving MEPs",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Dexmedetomidine provides sedation via alpha-2 receptor activation in the locus coeruleus, inducing a sleep-like EEG pattern with relatively limited suppression of cortical and spinal excitability compared with higher-dose GABAergic agents, thereby preserving MEPs and SEPs. Distractor A is incorrect because dexmedetomidine is not a GABA agonist."

"Question": "During thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with MEP and SEP monitoring, nitrous oxide 50% is added to a regimen of low-dose sevoflurane (0.4 MAC) and propofol. Within 10 minutes, MEP amplitudes decrease by 60%, whereas SEPs show minor changes. MAP and temperature are stable. Which anesthetic change is most appropriate to improve MEP reliability?",
"OptionA": "Increase nitrous oxide to 70%",
"OptionB": "Discontinue nitrous oxide and reduce sevoflurane toward 0–0.3 MAC while increasing TIVA support",
"OptionC": "Stop propofol and run sevoflurane at 1.0 MAC",
"OptionD": "Add benzodiazepines for deeper anesthesia",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Nitrous oxide and volatile agents significantly depress MEPs; discontinuing nitrous oxide and minimizing volatile anesthetic while relying on TIVA improves corticospinal excitability and MEP amplitude. Distractor A is incorrect because increasing nitrous oxide worsens MEP suppression."

"OptionB": "Childhood/juvenile absence epilepsy spectrum with typical absence seizures",
"OptionC": "Psychogenic non-epileptic events",
"OptionD": "Metabolic encephalopathy",

"Question": "A BAEP recording is contaminated by ongoing muscle activity from jaw clenching, which appears as irregular high-frequency noise. Which technical adjustment is most appropriate to reduce this artifact while preserving BAEP waves?",
"OptionA": "Raise the high-pass filter to 500 Hz",
"OptionB": "Ask anesthesia to deepen neuromuscular blockade or reduce jaw muscle tone, and ensure the patient’s jaw and head are supported to minimize EMG",
"OptionC": "Lower the low-pass filter to 30 Hz",
"OptionD": "Increase stimulus intensity to 120 dB nHL",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Muscle artifact is best reduced by minimizing muscle activity, including adequate neuromuscular blockade and careful positioning; excessive filtering risks distorting the short-latency BAEP components. Distractor A is incorrect because raising the high-pass filter too much can attenuate BAEP waves."

MRI reveals a left occipital infarct extending to involve the splenium of the corpus callosum. Which disconnection best explains his alexia without agraphia?",
"OptionA": "Disconnection of right visual cortex from left frontal motor cortex",
"OptionB": "Disconnection of right visual cortex from left language (angular gyrus) areas via splenial callosal fibers",
"OptionC": "Disconnection of left motor cortex from Broca area",
"OptionD": "Disconnection of cerebellum from red nucleus",
"CorrectAnswer": "B",
"Explanation": "Alexia without agraphia occurs when visual information from the right occipital cortex cannot reach left language regions due to splenial callosal damage; the patient can write but cannot read, including self-produced text. Distractor A is incorrect because the disconnection involves the corpus callosum, not a direct cortical–frontal pathway."
